## Chess

Work In Progress!

I started this project because I wanted to try to develop a bot that traverses different future scenarios and evaluates each on to find which one is best. 
And maybe add a libary with good moves so it doesn't need to do all calculation every time the bot is runned. I decided that chess would be a great game to make a bot for, also I like chess.
I've mostly have had really good experience with programming in C. So I wanted to learn C++ and that's why I decided on this language. Also because Chess is a very logical and stateoriented game I figured it would also fit pretty well performence wise.
