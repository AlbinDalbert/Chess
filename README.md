## Chess

Update!: This reposetory has been abandon and all of the work here will be rebuilt and refactoured into a program built in Rust, there are two main reasons for this. First, the decition to use SFML did not fit the nature of this project as physics and sprites are not very central to the functionality, and personally I'm much more interested in programing this in Rust as it's abstraction seems more relevant to a program with a graphical interface while still having a relativly high performence.

Work In Progress!

I started this project because I wanted to try to develop a bot that traverses different future scenarios and evaluates each on to find which one is best. 
And maybe add a libary with good moves so it doesn't need to do all calculation every time the bot is runned. I decided that chess would be a great game to make a bot for, also I like chess.
I've mostly have had really good experience with programming in C. So I wanted to learn C++ and that's why I decided on this language. Also because Chess is a very logical and stateoriented game I figured it would also fit pretty well performence wise.
